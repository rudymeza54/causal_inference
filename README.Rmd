# Causal Inference

## ASU Program Evalutaion

[Foundations of Program Evaluation 3: Advanced Regression Tools](https://asuonline.asu.edu/online-degree-programs/graduate/program-evaluation-and-data-analytics-ms/)

This course builds on previous program evaluation courses through translating each specific form of the counterfactual — pre-post with comparisons, reflexive design and the post-test only design — into specific regression models that leverage each counterfactual. You will learn how to estimate several common regression models that leverage unique data and counterfactual specifications.
